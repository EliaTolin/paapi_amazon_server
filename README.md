## About The Project

PAAPI Amazon Webserver is a webserver that simplifies operations through api pa.

 It allows the caching of offers of the requested categories, for a configurable time, saved in a Redis database.
It is possible to use this server as a backend for applications or web pages where offers are displayed.

PAAPI Amazon Server has the automatisms you are looking for for offers and limit the consumption of API requests.

## Built With

The server use Redis for the cache and Flask as the web server.
Use a wrapper for pa api.

* [PAAPI Amazon Python wrapper](https://github.com/sergioteula/python-amazon-paapi)

## Getting Started

It is recommended to use a virtualenv.
A Docker is provided that allows the use of Redis, if you want you can use your own Redis database.

### Installation

1. Get AP Amazon credentials.
2. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/EliaTolin/paapi_amazon_webserver/
```

3. Install dependencies

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Enter your API Credentials in `config.py`

```py
AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
AMAZON_SECRET_KEY = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
AMAZON_PARTNER_ID = 'YOUR_PARTNER_ID'
AMAZON_COUNTRY = 'YOUR_COUNTRY_ID'
```

4. Start webserver.

```shell
python main.py
```

Be sure you have a redis instance.

Otherwise use the Docker-compose for development but before configure the config.py file.

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```


## Usage

The webserver provides two endpoints, others will be in development if requested.
- **/api/v1/pa_amazon/search_product**

	Use this to have products returned to you based on the parameters provided.


- **/api/v1/pa_amazon/get_category_offers**

	Use this to make you return the products on offer or not regarding a certain category, it saves it in the DB with a timeout, if it is requested 	again it provides the results saved in the cache without re-downloading them. It has systems to handle the TooManyRequest error.
